  Abstract                 = {The ability to recognize the close associates of other group members may permit the display of redirected aggression against the relatives of the former aggressor. However, the dominance structure and the kin-based alliance system of macaque society are expected not to favour the occurrence of this kin-oriented redirection. Nevertheless, within 1 h of being the victim of an attack, Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, were more likely to attack the former aggressor's kin than without such a conflict. The conditions under which the victim redirected against the former aggressor's kin were investigated. This kin-oriented redirection did not occur preferentially either after conflicts between individuals with unstable and/or uncertain dominance relationships or after conflicts with individuals that were unlikely to intervene in favour of their kin. Victims redirected against individuals that were younger than the former aggressor and often subordinate to the victim. They also redirected in an opportunistic way by joining polyadic interactions against the former aggressor's kin. The possibility that this kin-oriented redirection may have a long-term function in changing the aggressive attitude of the aggressor towards the victim is also discussed. In addition, the victim's kin also displayed a form of kin-oriented redirection. They were more likely to attack the kin of an individual after it had attacked their own kin.},

  Abstract                 = {Blood revenge is one of the most commonly cited causes of violence and warfare in tribal societies, yet it is largely ignored in recent anthropological theories of primitive warfare. A theory of tribal violence is presented showing how homicide, revenge, kinship obligations, and warfare are linked and why reproductive variables must be included in explanations of tribal violence and warfare. Studies of the Yanomam{\"o} Indians of Amazonas during the past 23 years show that 44 percent of males estimated to be 25 or older have participated in the killing of someone, that approximately 30 percent of adult male dealths are due to violence, and that nearly 70 percent of all adults over an estimated 40 years of age have lost a close genetic relative due to violence. Demographic data indicate that men who have killed have more wives and offspring than men who have not killed.},

When a rejecter's group membership is salient during an act of rejection, the rejectee ostensibly associates the rejecter's group with rejection and retaliates against the group. Both experiments manipulated whether an aggregate of three persons appeared as separate individuals or members of an entity-like group and whether one of those persons rejected the participant. Consistent with the hypothesis, participants who experienced both rejection and perceived groupness behaved more aggressively against the aggregate (Experiment 1) and evidenced less favorable affective associations toward the aggregate (Experiment 2) than did participants who did not experience both rejection and perceived groupness.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {We provide a new framework for understanding 1 aspect of aggressive conflict between groups, which we refer to as vicarious retribution. Vicarious retribution occurs when a member of a group commits an act of aggression toward the members of an outgroup for an assault or provocation that had no personal consequences for him or her but which did harm afellow ingroup member. Furthermore, retribution is often directed at outgroup members who, themselves, were not the direct causal agents in the original attack against the person's ingroup. Thus, retribution is vicarious in that neither the agent of retaliation nor the target of retribution were directly involved in the original event that precipitated the intergroup conflict. We describe how ingroup identification, outgroup entitativity, and other variables, such as group power, influence vicarious retribution. We conclude by considering a variety of conflict reduction strategies in light of this new theoretical framework.},
